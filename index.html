        <p id="tsc-employment"> The TSC has made a major asseveration on how it will be absorbing teachers in the near future. <br> This comes shortly after the president of the republic of Kenya had promised his goverment would employ more than 1 million teachers in a span of 10 years.<br> To visit the site, click the link below</p>

<P id="CSS"> The process of recruiting teachers seems to be a very lucrative practice to the politicians who are seen posting videos and letters inviting teachers to certain closed door meetings.<br> This comes after the Mp for Kiharu constituency posted on his social media page a letter invinting all the non-employed teachers from his area to a meeting.</P>

    <h3>Poem. <br>The Resilience of Loneliness</h3>
    <p class="resilience-poem">Today, <br>
        I lazily woke up, woken, <br>
        Physically broken, <br>
        Mentally sullen, <br>
        No books did I want to open, <br>
    So, I woke up and the book I opened. <br>
</p>
<p class="resilience-poem">Still, I was Lazy,<br>
With my body so heavy and hazy, <br>
I didnt want the closet to organize, <br>
I sat there to agonize, <br>
But, my closet, I had to masculinize.</p>
<p class="resilience-poem"> It is a Monday, <br>
It is a holiday <br>
"Why go to the gym today?" <br>
"Ah, I will go someday," <br>
"Ah, I will go tomorrow, it's just a today." <br>
"Ooh, Yes, I will go at midday," <br>
No way! <br>
My intergrity will decay, <br>
So, to the gym, I went, anyway.<br>
</p>
<p class="resilience-poem"> Alone on the way I was, <br>
because a <strong>holiday</strong>  'twas, <br>
No trailing, traffic, <br>
No terrific, trilling, trolling, trucks <br>
No dogs, drums, drunks, <br>
Just steps, sighs, sniffles, strides, <br>
Just muscles, bronchioles and bones. <br>
</p>
<p class="resilience-poem"> Inside the gym, <br>
as silent as a grave, <br>
a loud silence of a <em>holiday</em>, <br>
I became hard and brave, <br>
While I <strong>bravely heave</strong>, <br>
To embrace pain by clamp, grip, grit, <br>
To fix my flesh, mind, spirit, <br>
</p>
<p class="resilience-poem"> Because, <br>
    the rocky path is lonelinee, <br>
    the winding route ie emptiness, <br>
    to the <em>mountain</em> top is steepness, <br>
    For, it is lonely at the top! <br>

    <P>Raila decided to be part of the former president's regime, a regime that the sitting president disowned in disguise. <br> However, before the elections, the so called deep state hoodwinked and assured the former PM of their robust support. <br> Little did Baba know that, this was a long con as a lot had a happened behind the scene. </P>

        <h1>BENEFITS OF FASTING</h1>
        <P id="fasting-magics"> Fasting is magical. <br> It has multiple benefits to our body. Infact human beinss are rewired not to eat <strong>everytime</strong>.<br> A man is expected to eat one meal a day or two meals a day, what we call OMAD and 2MAD respectively. <br> No man should think about breakfast as an important meal of the day. <br> These two works wonders in our bodies.<br> To start, fasting helps our body to go into ketosis, a process where the body produces its own energy. The energy helps to keep the brain of fire.</P>
